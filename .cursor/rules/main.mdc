# FluxoX

**Author:** theyashdhiman04

FluxoX is a multi-agent flow orchestration platform. The backend is FastAPI; flow execution is handled by the FlowEngine in `app/flow/engine.py`, with optional LangGraph.

## Conventions

- Use `/flows` for flow CRUD and templates; keep execute and metrics on their routers.
- Prefer async for I/O (DB, flow execution).
- Config via `app.config.config` and environment variables.
- Tests patch `app.flow.engine.FlowEngine` and use `/flows`, `/execute` as needed.

## Structure

- `app/flow/` – FlowEngine and FlowState
- `app/api/` – flows, agents, execute, metrics
- `app/auth/` – JWT and auth routes
- `app/database/` – DB init and connection (fluxox.db, aiosqlite)
